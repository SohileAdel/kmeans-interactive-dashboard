# kmeans-interactive-dashboard

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective and Description
The purpose of this project is to create a tool that will allow anyone to build a model without code. Building a model based on the highest-variance features in our dataset and creating several visualizations to communicate our results. In this project, I'm going to combine all of these elements into a dynamic web application that will allow users to choose their own features, build a model, and evaluate its performance through a graphic user interface.
